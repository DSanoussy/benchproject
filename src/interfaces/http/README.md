# `src/interfaces/http/` Folder

This directory contains the HTTP-related code, including route definitions and request handlers. This is where the application exposes its functionality as a web service.

## Example Components

- **user_handler.rs**: Handles HTTP requests related to users, such as creating a new user or retrieving user details.
- **todo_list_handler.rs**: Handles HTTP requests related to todo lists, such as creating a new list, retrieving all lists, or deleting a list.
- **task_handler.rs**: Handles HTTP requests related to tasks, such as adding a new task to a list, updating a task, or marking a task as complete.

Each handler typically interacts with the application services to process requests and generate responses.
