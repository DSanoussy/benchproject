# `src/interfaces/http/views/` Folder

This directory contains the Views objects, which are responsible for formatting and preparing the data that will be sent as responses to HTTP requests. These objects transform domain entities into a structure that is suitable for external representation, typically in formats like JSON or XML.

## Example Views

- **user_view.rs**: Defines how user data is presented in the response to HTTP requests related to user actions. This View might format fields like `id`, `username`, `email`, and exclude internal fields like `password_hash`.
- **todo_list_view.rs**: Defines how todo list data is presented in the response to HTTP requests related to todo list actions.

Views ensure that the internal representation of data is decoupled from its external representation, providing flexibility and security.
