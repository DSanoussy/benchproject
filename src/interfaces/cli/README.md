# `src/interfaces/cli/` Folder

This directory contains the command-line interface (CLI) related code, allowing users to interact with the application through a terminal or shell.

## Example Components

- **user_cli.rs**: Provides commands for managing users, such as creating a user or listing all users.
- **todo_list_cli.rs**: Provides commands for managing todo lists, such as creating a new list, adding tasks, or viewing all tasks in a list.
- **task_cli.rs**: Provides commands for managing tasks directly from the command line, such as marking tasks as completed or assigning tags.

The CLI interface allows for direct interaction with the application's features without needing to use the web interface, useful for automation or scripting.
