# `src/interfaces/routes/` Folder

This directory organizes the routing logic, which maps incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate handlers in the application.

## Example Routes

- **user_routes.rs**: Defines the HTTP routes for user-related actions, such as creating a new user, updating user information, or retrieving user data.
- **todo_list_routes.rs**: Defines the HTTP routes for managing todo lists, including creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting lists.
- **task_routes.rs**: Defines the HTTP routes for managing tasks within a todo list, including adding, updating, deleting, and completing tasks.

Routing is a critical part of the HTTP interface, directing requests to the appropriate logic in the application services.
