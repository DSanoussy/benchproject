# `src/application/use_cases/` Folder

This directory contains the use cases, which define specific business operations or actions that the application can perform. Each use case is focused on a single task, such as creating a new todo list or adding a tag to a task.

## Example Use Cases

- **create_todo_list.rs**: Implements the logic for creating a new todo list with a specific theme.
- **add_task_to_list.rs**: Implements the logic for adding a task to an existing todo list.
- **assign_tag_to_task.rs**: Implements the logic for assigning a tag to a specific task.

Use cases are invoked by application services and are central to implementing business processes.
