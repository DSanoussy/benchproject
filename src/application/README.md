# `src/application/` Folder

This directory contains the application services and use cases, which represent the core business logic of the TodoList application. The application layer is responsible for coordinating tasks between the domain and infrastructure layers.

## Contents

- **services/**: Contains the application services that encapsulate business logic related to managing todo lists, tasks, tags, and more.
- **use_cases/**: Contains specific use cases that represent well-defined business operations, such as creating a new todo list, adding a task, or tagging a task.

This layer is designed to be independent of external technologies, making it easier to test and extend.
