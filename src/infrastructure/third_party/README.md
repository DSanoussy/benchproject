# `src/infrastructure/third_party/` Folder

This directory contains integrations with external APIs or services that don't fit neatly into the other infrastructure categories, such as social media APIs, third-party authentication systems, or external data sources.

## Example Integrations

- **some_external_api.rs**: Implements interaction with a third-party API, such as retrieving data from an external task management service or integrating with a calendar service to sync due dates.
- **social_media_integration.rs**: Provides functionality for sharing tasks or lists to social media platforms, or for logging in using social media accounts.

These integrations allow the application to extend its functionality by leveraging external services, while keeping the core business logic clean and focused.
