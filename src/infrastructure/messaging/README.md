# `src/infrastructure/messaging/` Folder

This directory contains the code related to messaging systems, such as RabbitMQ. It includes the implementation of the messaging repository interface and the necessary logic for sending and receiving messages.

## Example Implementations

- **rabbitmq.rs**: Implements the `MessagingRepository` interface using RabbitMQ, allowing the application to publish and consume messages asynchronously (e.g., sending notifications when a task is due).

The messaging layer handles interaction with external messaging systems, enabling the application to perform asynchronous operations or integrate with other systems.
